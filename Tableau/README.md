# Tableau 

Tableau is a very powerful tool for data visualization. I will include the notes and some practice I did in this directory. 

The practice are based on two Udemy courses, [Hands-on Tableau](https://www.udemy.com/tableau10/learn/v4/overview) and [Advanced Tableau](https://www.udemy.com/tableau10/learn/v4/overview). The datasets used can be found [here](https://www.superdatascience.com/tableau/).
